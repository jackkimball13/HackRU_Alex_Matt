Inspiration
At first we were unsure of what to do since this was our first HackRU experience. After speaking to the different sponsors and asking about their API's, the idea came to us to utilize Twilio and IBM Watson in a cohesive fashion.

What it does?
This app is basically a text-to-translate service. It creates a server that recieves texts to a specific number (732-624-6140), and based on formatting translates the message between any two of a set of languages (English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic), and then sends a return text containing the translated token.

How we built it?
We utilize Twilio, and IBM Watson API's, as well as a custom server.

Challenges we ran into.
This was our first time working heavily with APIs, so it was a learning process figuring out how to implement them. Plus each API needed to be implemented in a different fashion that took time to learn and find proper documentation for. Setting up a server was another first, as well as having to learn how to code in javascript, use Node.js, and temporarily Maven. A lot of colaboration with sponsors and mentors really helped guide us through this.

Accomplishments we are proud of.
Finishing our first HackRU! Working succesfully with sponsor API's was very gratifying, as well as setting up the server.

What we learned.
-Twilio API
-IBM Watson API
-Maven
-Javascript for client side
-Ngrok
-Node.js for server side

What's next?
Using the IBM Watson API further to add in speech translation through the speech-to-text and text-to-speech tools, so by induction also adding phone call support that translates speech in real time. Add in a website that also interacts appropriately through online translations for speech and text.
